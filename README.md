## Overview

MusicStack is a revolutionary decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain that enables real-time royalty distribution for music performances and streaming. By leveraging Stacks' smart contracts and Bitcoin's security, we're solving the persistent challenge of fair, transparent, and instant royalty payments in the music industry.

### Key Features
